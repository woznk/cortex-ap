=Using X Plane for HIL simulation=

 * *X Plane setting* (source: www.skylabs.com)

   start X Plane 

   open the *operations & warnings* window

   set the *flight model per frame* value to *2*

   open the *setting / joystick, keys equipment* window

   select the *center* label

   set the three bars on the right to *0%* (*full left to most realism*) 

   move the nullzone bar (at the lower section of the window) to about 10%

   open the *setting / internet connections* window

   open the *advanced* tab, check the box *IP ofdata receiver*

   digit *127.0.01* in the leftmost text box 

   digit *49005* in the rightmost text box
     
   open the *UDP port tab*
     
   in the box *port that we receive on* select *49000*
     
   in the box *port that we send on* select *49001*
     
   in the box *port that we send to iPad on* select *49002*

 * *ApSim setting*

   start [http://code.google.com/p/cortex-ap/downloads/detail?name=ApSim.exe&can=2&q= Apsim.exe]
   
   in the *Simulator* group: 
   
   in the *IP* text box digit *127.0.0.1*
     
   in the *Port* text box digit *49005*

   in the *Telemetry* group: 
     
   select the serial port that the program will use to send / receive telemetry data to Cortex AP board
     
   select the baud rate for telemetry data

   in the *GPS* group: 

   select the serial port that the program will use to send GPS data to Cortex AP board

   select the baud rate for GPS data

 * *Cortex AP board Setup*

   connect the board's GPS port to the PC with an FTDI cable

   connect the board's telemetry port to the PC with an FTDI cable

   the board shall turn on

 * *Starting all*

   start python script attitude_socket.py

   make sure the aircraft in X Plane is leveled 

   in the ApSim program, click on *Start* button

   press the reset button on Cortex AP board
   (the board will calibrate the internal reference with the signal coming from the simulator)

   take off

   when ready, flip the *Mode* switch of the RC either to *Stabilize* or to *Auto*

   adjust PID settings

   flip the *Mode* switch of the RC back to *Manual* and then again to *Stabilize* or *Auto*
   (this resets the integral parts of the PID loops)
